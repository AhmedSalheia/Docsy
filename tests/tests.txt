1. Unit Tests
Focus: Individual classes and their methods (logic correctness, edge cases).

e. Exporters
For example, PostmanExporter

Test transformVariables() with simple and structured variables.

Test exporting a collection with requests and folders to Postman format.

Edge cases: empty collections, nested folders.

Later, when OpenAPI exporter added, similar tests.

2. Integration Tests
Focus: The package working as a whole or with Laravel framework.

Test bootstrapping the package (via service provider).

Test reading Laravel routes and auto-generating documentation.

Test environment variables propagate correctly.

Test exported JSON is valid Postman collection schema.

Test importing/exporting collections (if implemented).

Test error handling on invalid inputs.

3. Feature / Functional Tests
(May require Laravel Testbench or real Laravel app)

Test UI components if you build an API explorer/browser.

Test route testing interface (if you provide that).

Test authentication headers or variables are applied in requests.

Test saving/loading Postman collections via UI (if any).
